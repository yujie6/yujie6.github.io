- I am a second year PhD student at [Yale University](https://www.yale.edu/), [Yale Applied Cryptography Laboratory](https://sites.google.com/view/yacl) (YACL). And I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Charalampos Papamanthou](https://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/cpap/) and [Prof. Fan Zhang](https://www.fanzhang.me/).

- Before coming to Yale, I obtained my Bachelorâ€™s degree at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/).

- My main research interests lie in the general area of applied cryptography, currently I'm working on optimizing the performance of merkle tree in blockchain protocols.
