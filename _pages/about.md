- I am a second year PhD student at Yale University, Yale Applied Cryptography Laboratory (YACL). And I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Charalampos Papamanthou and Prof. Fan Zhang.

- Before coming to Yale, I obtained my Bachelorâ€™s degree at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

- My main research interests lie in the general area of applied cryptography, currently I'm working on optimizing the performance of merkle tree in blockchain protocols.
